# OWASP Dependency Check

[OWASP's `dependency-check`](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) scans software to identify the use of known vulnerable components. 
You can get `dependency-check` from its [GitHub repository](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/).

## Working principle
[`dependency-check` works](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/internals.html) by scanning files using so-called *analyzers*. The information collected during the scan is referred to as *evidence*. There are three types of evidence collected: 
* vendor
* product
* version.

As an example, the `JarAnalyzer` collects information from the Manifest `pom.xml` and the package names within the JAR files scanned.

Each CVE Entry in the NVD CVE database has a list of vulnerable software:
```xml
<entry id="CVE-2012-5055">

-- snip --

    <vuln:vulnerable-software-list>
        <vuln:product>cpe:/a:vmware:springsource_spring_security:3.1.2</vuln:product>
        <vuln:product>cpe:/a:vmware:springsource_spring_security:2.0.4</vuln:product>
        <vuln:product>cpe:/a:vmware:springsource_spring_security:3.0.1</vuln:product>
    </vuln:vulnerable-software-list>

-- snip --

</entry>
```

These [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Platform_Enumeration) are read "cpe:/[Entry Type]:[Vendor]:[Product]:[Version]:[Revision]:â€¦". `dependency-check` downloads the CPE data, stores it in a Lucene Index, and compares the collected evidence to the Lucene CPE Index. If there is a match, the associated CVE entries are added to the report.

The evidence is rated using confidence levels "low", "medium", "high", and "highest". When the CPE is determined it is given a confidence level that is equal to the lowest level confidence level of evidence used during identification. As a result, because the CPE identification might be incorrect, `dependency-check` report can contain both false positives and false negatives.

Currently, `dependency-check` does not use file hashes for identification, the rationale being that if the dependency is built from source, the hash will likely not match the published hash. As a result, one would need a hash database for known vulnerabilities. The authors of `dependency-check` made a deliberate design decision to avoid maintaining such a database (however, [they state](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/thereport.html) that a future enhancement may add some hash matching for very common libraries like Spring or Struts).

## Installation
You can download the current `dependency-check` version and unpack it from https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases. Simply unzip the file and you're good to go. Assuming you are on a Linux operating system, you run the tool by executing `dependency-check/bin/dependency-check.sh`.

## Vulnerable application example
If you don't have a Java Developer Kit installed on your system, you first need to e.g., (works for Ubuntu):

```bash
$ sudo apt install default-jdk -y
```

The example vulnerable Java application was created using Apache Maven:

```bash
$ mvn -B archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.vulncom.app -DartifactId=vuln-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
```

The above commands create a Java application where a Hello World class resides in `src/main/java/com/vulncom/app/App.java`:

```Java
package com.vulncom.app;

/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 */
public class App 
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        System.out.println( "Hello World!" );
    }
}
```

Based on [Apache's log4j 1.2 manual](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html), simple logging functionality was added:

```Java
package com.vulncom.app;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;

/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 */
public class App 
{
    // create a static logger
    private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(App.class);

    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        // Set up a simple configuration that logs on the console.
        BasicConfigurator.configure();

        System.out.println( "Hello World!" );

        // logging
        logger.debug("Some debug information");
    }
}
```

In addition, the vulnerable version of `log4j` was added to the application's `pom.xlm` file:

```xml
-- snip --
   <dependencies>

   -- snip ---

      <dependency>
         <groupId>log4j</groupId>
         <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
         <version>1.2.17</version>
         <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>

-- snip --
```

To compile the vulnerable application:

```bash
$ cd vuln-app/
$ mvn compile
```

You can then run the default unit test or to run the vulnerable app itself:

```bash
$ mvn test
$ mvn exec:java
```

Before scanning the application with `dependency-check` you need to instruct Maven to download all dependencies your application is using:

```bash
$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
```

The above command will download all dependencies into `vuln-app/target/dependency`. This step is needed because &mdash; as [explained by Jeremy Long](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/2470), the creator and maintainer of `dependency-check` &mdash; the tool does not just analyze a `pom.xml` outside of a Maven build. The reason for this is that `dependency-check` is not able to resolve the [transitive dependencies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41725810/what-is-a-transitive-maven-dependency). If it would analyze only `pom.xml`, it would only have limited evidence for CPE identification for the direct dependencies. In addition, `pom.xml` can be very complex with properties, profiles, dependency management section, parent `pom.xml` files, and so on; it is better to let Maven properly handle these complexities.

For more information on Maven, see [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).
 

## Running `dependency-check`
You can now run `dependency-check` on the vulnerable application in the `vuln-app` directory (the option `-s` is the scan path):
```bash
$ dependency-check.sh -s vuln-app/
```

You might need to prefix `dependency-check.sh` with the path where you actually unpacked the [zipped release](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases) or add that path to your `$PATH` variable.

## Example terminal output
If your setup is correct, you should see something like this:
```bash
